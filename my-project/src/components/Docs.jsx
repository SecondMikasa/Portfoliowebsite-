            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence, over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Instead of owning physical data centers or servers, businesses can rent computing resources on-demand, only paying for what they use.
